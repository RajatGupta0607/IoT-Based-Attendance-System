# IoT-Based Attendance System

*We built this **IoT-Based Attendance System** to simplify and automate attendance tracking using NFC technology. The system allows students and faculty to log attendance by tapping their I-Cards with NFC Tag on an NFC-enabled device. It eliminates manual roll calls or paper-based tracking, ensuring efficiency and time-saving. The web application provides real-time attendance insights with role-based access; faculty can manage users and view all attendance records. New users can be added while students can track their attendance.*

## Problem Statement:
We noticed that attendance in schools and colleges is taken manually, which takes up much time. Faculty has to spend extra minutes marking attendance for others. To address this, we proposed an IoT-Based Attendance System that uses NFC Cards and a cloud database to automate the process. This can help reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and make attendance marking more convenient.

## Our Objectives With the Project
1. We are developing an IoT-Based Attendance System using NFC Cards to automatically mark attendance.
2. We will store attendance records in a cloud database to access them easily. 
3. We are also making a web app that allows real-time attendance tracking by faculty and students.
4. On the faculty's side, we will generate reports to help analyze attendance data. 
5. On the student's side, they can view their attendance.

## Benefits & Business Case

### Who Benefits?
- Our system helps to automate attendance tracking, so teachers don't have to take roll calls manually.
- Students can check their attendance anytime from anywhere through the web app and avoid attendance shortages
- Teachers can focus on teaching instead of marking attendance and generate reports to track student's attendance.

### How the Data is Useful?
- All attendance is stored in a cloud database, making access easy and reducing the chances of missing or incorrect records.
- Schools can analyze attendance patterns to identify students who frequently miss class and take action early.
- Parents and students can check attendance records anytime, reducing confusion about attendance shortages.
