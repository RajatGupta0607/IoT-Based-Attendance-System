# IOT Based Attendance System

*We built this **IoT-Based Attendance System** to simplify and automate attendance tracking using NFC technology. The system allows students and faculty to log attendance by tapping their I-Cards with NFC Tag on an NFC-enabled device. It eliminates manual roll calls or paper-based tracking, ensuring efficiency and time-saving. The web application provides real-time attendance insights with role-based access; faculty can manage users and view all attendance records. New users can be added while students can track their attendance.*
